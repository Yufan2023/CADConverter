##  Demo: Combining Heart (.stl) + Tire (.dxf) Models

This demonstration shows how the MultiCAD Converter merges files from different CAD systems:

- **Heart Model** (FreeCAD, `.stl`): Mesh geometry
- **Tire Model** (AutoCAD, `.dxf`): Surface faces

✅ Selected files: `heart.stl`, `tire.dxf`  
✅ Output format: `STEP` (solid model)  
✅ Result: One unified CAD file ready for further editing or cloud storage.

Through a few simple steps — selecting files, choosing an output format, and clicking **Convert & Merge** — complex cross-platform models are combined without data loss, lightweight for cloud collaboration, and usable across major CAD software.
