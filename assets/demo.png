This demonstration shows how the MultiCAD Converter tool can combine a mesh-based 3D model (.stl) and a drawing-based 3D model (.dxf) into a single output file, ready for further CAD operations or visualization.

We specifically combine:

A heart model exported from FreeCAD in .stl format

A tire model exported from AutoCAD in .dxf format
