# 🛠️ Multi-CAD Converter

A user-friendly Python application for merging and converting 3D model files across multiple formats: `.STL`, `.OBJ`, `.DXF`, and `.STEP`. With just a few clicks, engineers, designers, and researchers can consolidate geometry and export in their desired format using a visual interface built with `tkinter`.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Multi-format support**: Input files in `.stl`, `.obj`, `.dxf`, or `.step`
- 🧠 **Preserves geometry**: Uses `pythonOCC` to maintain B-Rep accuracy for STEP files
- 🧩 **Merging capability**: Combine multiple files into one unified mesh or STEP assembly
- 📤 **Export options**: Save merged output as `.stl`, `.obj`, `.dxf`, or `.step`
- 🖥 **GUI-based**: Easy to use interface, no need to write code
